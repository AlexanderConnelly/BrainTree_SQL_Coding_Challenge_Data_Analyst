Data Integrity Checking & Cleanup

- Alphabetically list all of the country codes in the continent_map table that appear more than once. Display any values where country_code is null as country_code = "FOO" and make this row appear first in the list, even though it should alphabetically sort to the middle. Provide the results of this query as your answer.

- For all countries that have multiple rows in the continent_map table, delete all multiple records leaving only the 1 record per country. The record that you keep should be the first one when sorted by the continent_code alphabetically ascending. Provide the query/ies and explanation of step(s) that you follow to delete these records.

SELECT COALESCE([country_code],'FOO')
      
  FROM [dbo].[continent_map]

  group by country_code

  having COUNT(*) > 1

  order by country_code;

Results from first part of question selecting duplicates and brining NULL up top.

country_code:
FOO
ARM
AZE
CYP
GEO
KAZ
RUS
TUR
UMI

Part 2:

/* Create a temporary table with a new column ID as a row_number on the table after order by contry_code, continent_code*/
 SELECT row_number() over (order by country_code, continent_code asc) as 'ID',[country_code]
      ,[continent_code] into temp_table
  FROM [dbo].[continent_map] ;
  
/*Delete the rows that dont have a min ID number after group by country_code*/
  Delete From temp_table where ID NOT IN (Select MIN(ID) from temp_table group by country_code);
  
/*Reset continent_map table*/
Delete From continent_map;

/*Refill continent_map from temp_table*/
insert into continent_map
  select country_code, continent_code from temp_table;
 
 /*drop temp_table*/
 DROP TABLE temp_table

Results in Table continent_map:

country_code	continent_code
NULL	AS
ABW	NA
AFG	AS
AGO	AF
AIA	NA
ALA	EU
ALB	EU
AND	EU
ANT	NA
ARE	AS
ARG	SA

2\. List the countries ranked 10-12 in each continent by the percent of year-over-year growth descending from 2011 to 2012.

The percent of growth should be calculated as: ((2012 gdp - 2011 gdp) / 2011 gdp)

The list should include the columns:

- rank
- continent_name
- country_code
- country_name
- growth_percent

/* in order to do this one I first created a VIEW in my data base which joined the per_capita table to all other tables appropriately. the join looks like this*/

SELECT        dbo.per_capita.country_code, dbo.continents.continent_code, dbo.continents.continent_name, dbo.countries.country_name, dbo.per_capita.year, dbo.per_capita.gdp_per_capita
FROM            dbo.continent_map INNER JOIN
                         dbo.countries ON dbo.continent_map.country_code = dbo.countries.country_code INNER JOIN
                         dbo.continents ON dbo.continent_map.continent_code = dbo.continents.continent_code INNER JOIN
                         dbo.per_capita ON dbo.continent_map.country_code = dbo.per_capita.country_code
                         
/* results from the select look like this:*/
country_code	continent_code	continent_name	country_name	year	gdp_per_capita
ABW	NA	North America	Aruba	2004	22566.68216
AND	EU	Europe	Andorra	2004	29372.16674

..... and on and on

/*Using this view as my dataset to refer to, I'll answer the GDP question with this query:*/




3\. For the year 2012, create a 3 column, 1 row report showing the percent share of gdp_per_capita for the following regions:

(i) Asia, (ii) Europe, (iii) the Rest of the World. Your result should look something like

 Asia  | Europe | Rest of World 
------ | ------ | -------------
25.0%  | 25.0%  | 50.0%

4a\. What is the count of countries and sum of their related gdp_per_capita values for the year 2007 where the string 'an' (case insensitive) appears anywhere in the country name?

4b\. Repeat question 4a, but this time make the query case sensitive.

5\. Find the sum of gpd_per_capita by year and the count of countries for each year that have non-null gdp_per_capita where (i) the year is before 2012 and (ii) the country has a null gdp_per_capita in 2012. Your result should have the columns:

- year
- country_count
- total

6\. All in a single query, execute all of the steps below and provide the results as your final answer:

a. create a single list of all per_capita records for year 2009 that includes columns:

- continent_name
- country_code
- country_name
- gdp_per_capita

b. order this list by:

- continent_name ascending
- characters 2 through 4 (inclusive) of the country_name descending

c. create a running total of gdp_per_capita by continent_name

d. return only the first record from the ordered list for which each continent's running total of gdp_per_capita meets or exceeds $70,000.00 with the following columns:

- continent_name
- country_code
- country_name
- gdp_per_capita
- running_total

7\. Find the country with the highest average gdp_per_capita for each continent for all years. Now compare your list to the following data set. Please describe any and all mistakes that you can find with the data set below. Include any code that you use to help detect these mistakes.

rank | continent_name | country_code | country_name | avg_gdp_per_capita 
---- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -----------------
   1 | Africa         | SYC          | Seychelles   |         $11,348.66
   1 | Asia           | KWT          | Kuwait       |         $43,192.49
   1 | Europe         | MCO          | Monaco       |        $152,936.10
   1 | North America  | BMU          | Bermuda      |         $83,788.48
   1 | Oceania        | AUS          | Australia    |         $47,070.39
   1 | South America  | CHL          | Chile        |         $10,781.71
